# OCR Translator App
Technologies used: Google's Cloud Vision and Translate APIs, PyQt, OpenCV, Python

This app translates text contained in images into different languages, and overlay the results onto the original image. The app could be used in foreign language classrooms where students find themselves having to translate many words and phrases in reading assignments. This app could save time by overlaying translations onto images of the assignment, allowing students to translate unknown words or phrases seamlessly. This application could also be used to translate legal documents/forms for non-native speakers. A mobile version could be used to translate street signs, flyers and documents when traveling abroad.
